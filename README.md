# Enhancing-the-Effectiveness-of-Online-Experiments-using-CUPED
#### CUPED is a technique that helps to reduce bias in online experiments. Bias can occur when certain user characteristics or other factors influence the assignment of users to the treatment or control group in an experiment. This can lead to inaccurate results and unreliable conclusions. By using CUPED, a platform like Booking.com can ensure that both the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of relevant characteristics, reducing the risk of bias.
